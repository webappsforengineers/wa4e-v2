Linearly increasing shear strength profiles with or without a surficial crust are permitted. The analysis is simplified and does not explicitly capture the effects internal stiffeners (either additional bearing resistance from the additional projected bearing area, or reduced internal wall friction from extrusion above stiffeners). The method is based on simple equations of wall friction and bearing resistance at the caisson tip. For sealed uplift capacity the tool is intended for caissons of sufficient embedment depth that a confined bearing failure occurs at tip level with the effect of wall friction superposed. The tool is not intended for prediction of sealed uplift resistance of shallow suction can or bucket foundations that would fail with a reverse end bearing mechanism that would reach the mudline. Undrained uniaxial vertical uplift mobilising full reverse end bearing can be approximated with the Shallow Foundations NcV app (assuming tensile reverse bearing capacity is of equal magnitude to compression bearing capacity). This app is appropriate for predicting the installation resistance for shallow suction cans as only compressive tip bearing and wall friction are mobilised; equally the app can be used to predict vented vertical uplift resistance of suction cans as these mechanisms only mobilised wall friction and/or plug weight. \nThe method presented was developed based on findings from a joint industry project described in “Suction anchors for deepwater applications”, by Andersen, K. et al.
