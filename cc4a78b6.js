Linearly increasing shear strength profiles with or without a surficial crust are permitted. The app uses a simple theoretical model to predict final padeye (and fluke) depth, i.e. for horizontal fluke position, from moment equilibrium, and holding capacity from bearing capacity theory and the load shed along the chain between mudline and anchor.  \nThe method was first published in “Performance of embedded anchor chains and consequences for anchor design” by Neubecker, S.R & Randolph, M.F. (1995), OTC 7712, and is presented in the text book <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315272474">“Offshore Geotechnical Engineering” by Randolph, M.F. and Gourvenec, S.
