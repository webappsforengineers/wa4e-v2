Increases in bearing capacity were identified through results from finite element analyses using a Modified Cam Clay constitutive model, from which a simple critical state inspired (CSI) theoretical framework was developed to predict the bearing capacity as a function of magnitude of preload, consolidation time, OCR and interface roughness. \nThe FEA results and theoretical framework are published in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/geot. 13.P.101">“A method for predicting the consolidated undrained capacity of shallow foundations on clay“ by Gourvenec, S., Vulpe, C. & Murthy, T.
