Changes in soil strength profile with depth below the sliding foundation can also be predicted. The app enables exploration of the sensitivity of geotechnical properties on the performance of the foundation over the whole life of the structure. The predictions are based on a critical state inspired (CSI) framework, that has been validated against centrifuge model tests, and is shown to capture the essential elements of the soil–structure interaction, which include: (a) the changing soil strength from cycles of sliding and pore pressure generation; (b) the regain in strength due to dissipation of excess pore pressure (consolidation); and (c) the soil contraction and consequent settlement of the foundation caused by the consolidation process. \nDetails of the centrifuge model tests underpinning the theoretical framework are published in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/geot.14.P.098"> “Tolerably mobile subsea foundations – Observations of performance” by Cocjin.
